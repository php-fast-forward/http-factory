## [1.3.0] - 2026-10-21

### Added

- Bundle the fast-forward-http-factory consumer skill with executable examples, optional installation guidance and Composer discovery metadata. ([#7](https://github.com/php-fast-forward/http-factory/pull/7))
- Restores the Fast Forward Container consumer skill through the existing development-only Composer skill manager, alongside the configured contributor skills, without changing runtime dependencies. ([#6](https://github.com/php-fast-forward/http-factory/pull/6))

### Changed

- Automate changelog checks, version pull requests and approved releases with Fast Forward Changelog, with the project skill available to contributors. ([#6](https://github.com/php-fast-forward/http-factory/pull/6))
- Synchronize the Config and Container consumer skills from the installed Composer dependencies through an explicit trusted-package list instead of independent GitHub sources. ([#6](https://github.com/php-fast-forward/http-factory/pull/6))
- Require fast-forward/container ^1.10 so installed Composer dependencies supply the supported Container consumer skill alongside the runtime library. ([#6](https://github.com/php-fast-forward/http-factory/pull/6))
- Restore the Changelog skill from its GitHub source during Composer installation instead of committing a generated copy and separate installation receipt. ([#6](https://github.com/php-fast-forward/http-factory/pull/6))
